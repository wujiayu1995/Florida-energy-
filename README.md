I chose Table chart and Line Chart for the data. Line chart is easier for visitor to compare the changes of the numbers. Since the line chart is graphic, it will help visitors to make more scene on the numbers.

The second one is Table chart, which is hard for people who are not familiar with numbers, but table chart interacts primarily with verbal system. Vistors can read them through the numbers and words, and it's helpful when people want to do the compare by themselves.
