The purpose of this redesign is to improve the user experience, create the most comfortable website for target users by changing the look of the website. This website is lack of creativity and it contains messy readable content. I’m assuming the main groups people of this website user are investors, scholars and students. 
Projects
・Horizontal and vertical Navigation bars have too many sections, which can confuse the user. It should be more clear and specific on classification.  
・The text size showing on mobile phone is too small for reading, and the clickable area is also too small for checking. My goal is to make the web design more user friendly, and include aesthetics taste. 
・According to the test result from esponsivedesignchecker.com, it seems like this website doesn’t have a mobile version design, this will also be on the to do list.


From the score that http://nibbler.silktide.com provides, we can see that;
・Overall: 6.9
・Accessibility: 9.0
・Experience: 5.9
・Technology: 10 (which means How well designed and built the website is)
Floridaenergy.ufl.edu is not a mobile friendly website, due to the test score, it shows that optimization of mobile access is 59/100, which is low. Desktop’s score is 65, conducted as medium. Photos are too big so that it takes time to process, photos should be compressed in order to save users’ time. And some of the javascript can be removed from the code. 
User experience score is 5.9/10, which means users are not so satisfied with the experience. The evaluation of site's responsiveness is normal, performance is not good, and the accessibility is not good too. Because this website contains too many contents and pictures, the pictures is before-compressed so it delay the process of the website. The functionality isn’t work so well, the download brochure on the homepage seems like it doesn’t work. And site map isn’t displayed as well.
